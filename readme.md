# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice with JavaScript

Welcome to my repository where I practice and consolidate my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript! ðŸŽ¯

## About This Repository

This repo serves as my personal learning space for exploring different data structures and algorithms. Here, I gather solutions to practice problems, document key concepts, and track my progress as I work through a variety of coding challenges. The focus is on improving problem-solving skills, optimizing algorithms, and reinforcing my understanding of computational complexity.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**:  
  Implementation of various data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, and more.
- **Algorithms**:  
  Solutions and explanations for algorithms involving Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, and more.

- **Practice Problems**:  
  A collection of problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeWars, and others, solved using JavaScript.

## How to Use

- Navigate through the folders to find various implementations and problem solutions.
- Each folder is organized by data structure/algorithm type, and within each, you will find:
  - **JavaScript code** with the problem solution.
  - **README files** explaining key concepts and providing insights into the thought process behind each solution.
  - **Test cases** where applicable.

## Goals

1. Improve my understanding of core data structures and algorithms.
2. Practice solving real-world coding problems.
3. Optimize code for better efficiency and readability.
4. Document my learning journey for future reference and growth.

## Contribution

This is primarily a personal project, but feel free to suggest improvements or share alternative solutions through pull requests.
